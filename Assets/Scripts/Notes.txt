TO DO (FIX LIST):

SetMovementTiles overlapping SetCombatTiles when using hotkeys or pressing HUD buttons while performCombat is active. DONE
When attacking -- performCombat -- the Unit is deselected. Change this, so it is similar to performMovement. DONE
When moving: call findAllUnits again when the Unit has stopped moving, so the player can still see where units are located on tiles (unitHighlight, PlayerHighlight & EnemyHighlight)
Units should not be able to attack themselves or their allies. Change this, very important! DONE
